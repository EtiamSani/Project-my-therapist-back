# My Therapist API 
## What the project my therapist about ? 
#### MyTherapist is a project that provides users in need with the ability to find the therapist that best suits their needs. We have developed an algorithm that analyzes the answers provided in a survey (which is stored in our database) and returns a list of therapists that are most suitable for the particular pathology/issue that the user wants to work on.
